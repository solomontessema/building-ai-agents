# Building Agentic AI with LangChain and LangGraph — Jupyter Notebooks



This repository contains the complete set of Jupyter notebooks used throughout the book *Building Agentic AI with LangChain and LangGraph* by **Solomon T. Tessema**. Each notebook corresponds to a chapter or project in the book and is designed to help readers explore, experiment with, and extend the concepts of agentic AI systems.



The notebooks are fully executable and follow the same environment used in the book to ensure consistency and reproducibility.



## About This Repository



The notebooks in this repository include:



- foundational examples of LangChain and LangGraph

- step-by-step agent construction

- tool integration patterns

- memory, retrieval, and RAG workflows

- multi-step reasoning loops

- full-stack agentic applications (SQL, visualization, email automation)



Each notebook is self-contained and annotated to reinforce the concepts introduced in the corresponding chapter.



## Technical Environment



All notebooks were developed and tested using the following environment:



- Python 3.13.1

- langchain 1.1.0

- langchain-openai 1.1.0

- langgraph 1.0.4

- langchain-tavily 0.2.12

- python-dotenv 1.1.1

- streamlit 1.51.0



To ensure smooth execution, it is recommended that readers match these versions.



## Installation



Clone the repository:



```bash

git clone https://github.com/solomontessema/building-agentic-ai.git

cd building-agentic-ai

```



## Using These Notebooks With the Book

Each notebook is aligned with a chapter in the book. You can:



- run the code exactly as shown



- modify examples to deepen understanding



- use the notebooks as templates for your own agentic AI projects



The book provides the conceptual foundation, while these notebooks provide the hands-on experience.
